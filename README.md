### Planned enhancements

```

user: pi
password: raspberry

- low voltage: bought cable and it works

- before anything
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

sudo apt-get install git
git config --global user.name "bebbo-zz"
git config --global user.email martin.brehm@web.de
git clone https://github.com/bebbo-zz/pythonserver.git

sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install flask

- for an update either in the server or website
git pull origin master

(sudo apt-get install python3.6) already there
... code file
... in folder of py file
sudo python webserver.py
(right now 192)

- how to run two processes at the same time without desktop


- how to automatically answer questions with y when installing and more disk space is required???

- run phyton APIs on raspberry pi 
    http://mattrichardson.com/Raspberry-Pi-Flask/
    

    a) for getting print job and calling web socket from there
    https://realpython.com/python-sockets/#echo-client
    https://www.w3resource.com/python/python-bytes.php

    b) and updating git files, basically run terminal commands


- edit files when there is no IDE. probably that is not the plan. rather good deployment strategy that would work everywhere. update on click

- start node server and python server whenever raspberry pi switches on and restart once terminated

- vue call ipad camera
- camera will recognize barcode
- user management
- create a new user with password and add him (here named admin) to sudo and adm group and later revoke the rights of the default user pi
    sudo adduser admin
    sudo adduser admin sudo
    sudo adduser admin adm
    sudo deluser pi sudo
    sudo deluser pi adm

```
